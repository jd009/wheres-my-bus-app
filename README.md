# Dude, where's my bus?

"Dude, where's my bus?" is a web app that displays the real-time location
of Austin Capital Metro busses.

"Dude, where's my bus?" is built on AngularJS with an Express backend
and leverages the Google Maps API.

This app queries a JSON file provided by Austin Capital Metro to
discover real-time information on the Austin Capital Metro bus
fleet.

Next, given the user's current location, the app will find
the closest bus that is on the desired route and heading in
the desired direction.  The app will color-code the closest
bus as green and then color-code the other busses on the same
route according to their compass direction.
